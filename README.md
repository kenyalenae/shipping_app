Web Client Final Project Shipping Application

For my project I created a prototype of a shipping/ordering application where users can sign up
and log into their accounts to create order requests to have items shipped to them.
The user has an account home page, ability to create order form and submit it,
ability to view their pending and completed orders and details about their orders,
and the ability to view/update their account information such as contact info and address info.

When the admin is logged into their account they should be able to view all orders made by all users.
The orders would be sectioned by user and the admin would have the ability to "complete" the order
so that the order would show under the "completed orders" section on the users account.
